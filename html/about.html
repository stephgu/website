	    <div class="about">
	    	Hi. I'm Stephanie Gu. I graduated from MIT in 2014 and I'm currently working at Amazon as a software developer.<br><br>

			I like to play games (specifically indie puzzle platformers), and I like to create them too.<br><br> I like simplicity and minimalism. I like thinking about how to make
			things simple and easy to understand for other people.<br><br> I enjoy figuring out the subtleties in designs that make people intuitively understand how to use them.<br><Br>

			I like being direct and having people be direct with me.<br><br>
			I really like it when you code something and it just works. <br><br>
