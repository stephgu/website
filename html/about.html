	    	Hi. I'm Stephanie Gu. I graduated from MIT in 2014 and I'm currently working at Amazon as a software developer. I like to play games (specifically indie puzzle platformers), and I like to create them too. I like simplicity, and I like thinking about how to make thing simple for other people. I think a lot about user experience in my free time, and I enjoy figuring out the subtleties in designs that make people intuitively understand how to use them. I like being direct and having people be direct with me. I really like it when you code something and it just works. <br><br>
