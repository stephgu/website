I first realized I had a passion for design some time in my senior year of college, after I took a game design class. The class would begin with a brainstorming session. No ideas were off limits; we could be as wild, creative, or silly as our minds allowed us to be. Sometimes in a magical moment you could distill all those thoughts into one single, pure idea. That feeling of tingling excitement was just the first step of the design process that I started to love.

After the initial spark of an idea, the second phase of the design process would start. It was my job to create mechanics that would best portray the main concept to the user, quickly create a prototype of it, then put it to the test. During the user tests, I was amazed by how the subtlest of properties, such as a button that was colored green or red, could completely change how the user interacted with it. As a designer, I translated the user's comments, confusion, and delight into tangible improvements to make the interface better. As I made iteration after iteration and watched as our testers' movements became more smooth and intuitive, I experienced a wonderful feeling of fulfillment.

I made three game prototypes during that class, then went on to make two more semester-long prototypes in the following year. After graduating I got an offer from Amazon and started working there as a software developer. I never forgot my passion for design though, and I would constantly seek out projects that would involve UX or a customer facing component. One of these projects was designing and creating customer email notifications for the Amazon Dash Replenishment Service (DRS), and another was implementing the UI that would allow customers to set up their DRS devices. Because our projects sometimes didn't have UX designers and had generally loose design scopes, I jumped on this opportunity to voice my opinions on how to improve our designs and make them more user-friendly. In the case of the emails, we had no UX input at all, so I designed the templates completely. I soon became known on my team as the one to go to for UX advice.

Most of my industry experience lies with software development, but I found that my engineering background has benefited me greatly when designing UX flows that are both realistic and effective. Often times knowing the underlying backend architecture allows me to create instructions and flows that strike the perfect amount of balance between accuracy and understandability to the user. Additionally, knowing basic web architectures, frameworks and design patterns allows me to create a UI that can be realistically implemented. For example, during certain points of the Dash button setup UI the user is connected to the button and therefore cannot connect to the internet. In our old UX flows there were segments where our designers told us to grab data from the web and display it when we could not. I found another way to pass this information to the user while keeping the integrity of the information.

I am fascinated by how design can shape the way a user interacts, understands, and even emotionally responds to a certain product. I want to use the knowledge and skills I have gained to help make whatever product I touch be the best for the customer that it can be. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my cover letter and I hope to be in contact with you soon.
